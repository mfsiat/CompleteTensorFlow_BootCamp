# TensorFlow Bootcamp Machine Learning

## What we will talk about? 
* we will talk about **supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, evaluation methods** and more. 
* ML algorithms can find insights in data. 

## Supervised Learning 
* It uses labeled data to predict a label given some features. 
* If the label is continuos than its called **regression**, if its categorical it is a **classification** problem. 
* Example for Classification Problem 
> Suppose we have some features **Height and Weights** and we have label **Gender** 
> we need to predict their **gender**. 

* Example for Regression Problem
> We have features like **Square Footage, Rooms** and we have label **House Price**, So given a house's size and number of rooms, predict the selling price. 

* Supervised Learning has the model train on historical data that is already labeled 
* Once the model is trained, it can then be used on new data, where only the features are known, to attempt prediction. 
* But if we dont have the historical labels then what will we do? we need to look for **patterns** in the data and find a structure. Then we move on to **Unsupervised Learning**
